They have a vast knowledge of the regional market, and I always felt that I could trust their judgement &amp; advice. They provided me with stellar recommendations for loan officers, inspectors, and attorneys, which was helpful as I did not have any contacts of my own. They also did a great job being an advocate for me as a buyer and negotiating with the seller. I would recommend them to anyone purchasing in Massachusetts and will be using them again when I decide to sell.”<\/p>\n\n\n\n

The process of getting the house ready for market was made as painless as possible. He also broke this daunting task into manageable chunks. He was very responsive to emails\/texts\/questions. Patient and professional. I would use him again in a heartbeat. “<\/p>\n\n\n\n

Selling a home of 35 years can be stressful, but he helped us through it, every step of the way.“<\/p>\n\n\n\n

Candidly, the sale was an emotional journey for me and my family. Gary and his partner Sue Gordon were incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. They provided both patience and sensitivity to my challenges and some gentle pushes when I needed a nudge to get over some hurdles. In the end, the house was beautifully staged, photographed, marketed and sold. It was a very positive experience. If you have a house to sell, I highly recommend Gary Kelley and Sue Gordon. They will get the job done right!”<\/p>\n\n\n\n

I have no doubt the process would&#8217;ve come with plenty of headaches had we worked with anyone else.<br><br>We didn&#8217;t have much experience with other real estate agents, and have no desire to work with anyone other than Sue and Gary after this experience. We are INCREDIBLY satisfied, and cannot recommend then more.”<\/p>\n\n\n\n

They were able to provide so many resources to us, and their knowledge of everything real estate is amazing. Every time we had a question or wanted to schedule a showing, we got a response from Sue or Gary very quickly. I really enjoyed working with Sue and Gary, and I would highly recommend them if you are looking for a realtor. They have a wealth of knowledge, they are so supportive, and I can’t imagine having gone through the process of buying and selling a house without them. Truly amazing people, give them a call today if you are thinking about buying or selling a house. “<\/p>\n\n\n\n

Gary and Sue are amazing agents to work with and we could not have chosen better. We all know right now is tough market for buyers and we were set on buying a turn-key house which made the house hunt extremely competitive. Gary and Sue were never pushy, they listened to us, and were determined to get us the house of our dreams. When we did put a bid in, they went the extra mile to provide guidance, and connect with the sellers&#8230;This is 100% why we were selected out of a trillion bids. During the process between bid and close, Gary and Sue were on every detail, each step of the way, and honestly, it was the smoothest process. This is the dynamic duo, and I will recommend them to all my friends and family.”<\/p>\n\n\n\n

From the first day we met them, to the last day for our final walk through, we felt like this dynamic duo were in our corner every step of the way, every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
<p>As first time home buyers we were full of excitement and endless questions and Gary did a wonderful job keeping us focused, and most importantly patient throughout our partnership! He answered every question we had, and even shared insightful tips along the way that really made us feel like we were always a top priority for him. A feeling I cannot understand in the current market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
<p>Gary and Sue worked their butts off for us, and we are endlessly grateful! For the early morning and late night showings, for all the tears you wiped, all the late nights you put in, all the lawyers you herded on our behalf to protect us, and the creativity you brought to the table for our purchase are just a few of the reasons you are the best team out there, and the reason we&#8217;ll be coming back to you for all of our home buying needs in the future.”<\/p>\n\n\n\n
<p><em>— Fiana Eber<\/em><\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<hr class='\"wp-block-separator' has-text-color has-blood-red-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-blood-red-background-color has-background>\n\n\n\n<div class='\"wp-block-group' has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-container-11 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained>\n<p>“Late last summer we were fortunate to have an unexpected opportunity to buy a retiring coworker&#8217;s home. It meant, however, we had to first sell our home rather quickly. We’re so glad we listed with Gary and Sue and–for many reasons–highly recommend their services to anyone who needs to sell their home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
<p>We had our first meeting with Gary and Sue in early October, hoping to close both transactions by December 15. The timing was tight, and their amazingly rapid responsiveness was key to pulling this off. They responded to every call, text, and email promptly, professionally, and with warmth and charm. When the time came for paperwork and looming deadlines, they kept everything moving on–and usually ahead of–schedule. Clear and timely communication is an area that Gary and Sue really have down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
<p>Beyond top notch communication, everything Gary and Sue brought to the table exceeded our expectations. From high quality marketing materials (including a gorgeous brochure with floor plan and an excellent 3D tour) to their recommendations (for a painter and an attorney), we can’t really imagine how any other team of real estate agents could have done a better job. Even though we were selling a relatively modest home, they treated our listing seriously and brought their very best to the table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
<p>Lastly, their willingness to help with aspects of the purchase of our new home&#8211;despite not receiving a single penny on that deal&#8211;speaks volumes to their character and demonstrates their client focused approach is what everyone should want in a listing agent. They are now two professionals whom we trust completely and genuinely enjoyed working with. If we ever need to buy or sell real estate they will be the first people we call.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
<p>Our story had a happy ending: both transactions closed on December 10, five days early. Our family just spent our first Christmas in our new home, in very large part, thanks to the efforts of Gary Kelley and Sue Gordon. Hire them. Enjoy their banter. Take any advice they share with you. You won’t regret it.”<\/p>\n\n\n\n

I had listed my home the year prior with the big online discount broker, and it didn&#8217;t sell. I guess you get what you pay for. Gary and Sue were very professional and efficient throughout the selling process, from preparing for listing through closing day. Minor repairs were done to enhance curb appeal. My home was professionally staged at no additional cost. The photos and flyers looked amazing and even included a custom website. They also took care of coordinating all the final inspections\/readings\/bills\/mortgage payoff. And the real kicker&#8211;it was only a half percent more than the &#8220;discount&#8221; broker! If I ever need to sell a home again, Gary and Sue will be my first (and hopefully only) call.”<\/p>\n\n\n\n

If you are looking to get a realtor, look no further. Gary does a great job in keeping you up to date on what houses have popped up, especially houses he believes you would be interested in. He makes sure to share with you important information you may never think about, through the entire process. And what was key for us, we never felt like we were being pushed into a house.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
<p>He gets that this could be your future home, so it needs to be a perfect fit for you, and he will keep helping you until you feel you have found it. He is kind, funny, and we are so happy we were lucky enough to have had friends who recommended him to us. Don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out!”<\/p>\n\n\n\n
